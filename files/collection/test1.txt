As me this is "sandeera sandeera".
"uthpala uhtpala uthpala".
In the sentences 'I like that cat'; 'do you like that cat?', we see two examples. 'I like that
cat' is declarative, or indicative, and shows, suggests, or states that I am fond of that
cat. The second sentence, 'do you like that cat?', is interrogative, as I wish to determine
your feelings on that particular cat.
'Be kind to that cat!' is a command, and, therefore, takes the imperative mood. Disregard imperative
sentences at your peril.
